# Atzlan a Repository to be Lazy

## IMPORTANT

All the scripts, unless otherwise noted, are geared towards macos users using bash shell.
Linux users may benefit depending on their shell configurations.

## What is Atzlan?

"Atzlan" is the English translation of the Hebrew word for lazy, indolent, or sluggish.
As the name implies, this repository is for those who seek to be "lazy" or are "lazy."
Joking aside, the purpose of this respository is to house scripts that can make you life
easier.

## Developers

### Executable Scripts

Make sure that the scripts are executable and according to your operating system.

To make a script executable, for unix users just do the following:

```
chmod +x <NAME_OF_EXECUTABLE_SCRIPT>
```

Make sure that you read the README.md for each of the scripts in order that you have the right
dependencies installed in order for the script to work
